The continue statement in Python is used 
to skip the current iteration of a loop (for loop or while loop) and 
move on to the next iteration. When a continue statement is encountered, 
the remaining statements in the loop are skipped for the current iteration, 
and control is passed back to the beginning of the loop for the next iteration.

The primary purpose of the continue statement is 
to selectively execute certain iterations of a loop, 
based on some condition. For example, 
if you want to process all the elements in a list,
but skip the ones that meet a certain condition, 
you can use the continue statement to do so.
